```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

```{r}
# data cleaning
df = read_csv("College.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(-college) %>% 
  select(outstate, everything()) %>% 
  na.omit()

# data partition
indexTrain = createDataPartition(y = df$outstate,
                                 p = 0.8,
                                 list = FALSE)


train_df = df[indexTrain, ]
test_df = df[-indexTrain, ]

x_train = model.matrix(outstate ~ ., train_df)[ , -1]
y_train = train_df$outstate

x_test = model.matrix(outstate ~ ., test_df)[ , -1]
y_test = test_df$outstate
```



## Exploratory data analysis (using train_df)

```{r}
# data dimension and summary
dim(train_df)

summary(train_df)

skimr::skim(train_df)
```

There are 453 rows and 17 columns in training data, all the variables are numeric.

```{r}
# set plot theme
theme1 = trellis.par.get()
theme1$plot.symbol$col = rgb(.2, .4, .2, .5)
theme1$plot.symbol$pch = 16
theme1$plot.line$col = rgb(.8, .1, .1, 1)
theme1$plot.line$lwd = 2
theme1$strip.background$col = rgb(.0, .2, .6, .2)
trellis.par.set(theme1)

# scatter plot
# all predictors are included since they are all continuous
featurePlot(
  x_train, 
  y_train, 
  plot = "scatter", 
  labels = c("","Out-of-state Tuition"),
  layout = c(4, 4))
```

From the scatter plot above, we can see that there might be some linear trends between the outcome variable `outstate` and some of the predictors, for example, `phd` and `terminal`.  


## Smoothing splines

```{r}
set.seed(2570)

# fit smoothing spline models using terminal as the only predictor of outstate 
fit_ss = smooth.spline(x = train_df$terminal, y = train_df$outstate)

# optimal degree of freedom obtained by generalized cross-validation
fit_ss$df
```

The optimal degree of freedom obtained by default cross validation is `r round(fit_ss$df, 3)`.  

Use this **optimal degree of freedom** to make following predictions:

```{r}
# make prediction using a grid of terminal values
# generate predictor grid
range(train_df$terminal)
terminal_grid <- seq(from = 24, to = 100, by = 1)

# make prediction
pred_ss = predict(fit_ss,
                  x = terminal_grid)

pred_ss_df = data.frame(predicted = pred_ss$y,
                        terminal = terminal_grid)

# plot test data
p = ggplot(data = test_df, aes(x = terminal, y = outstate)) +
     geom_point(color = rgb(.2, .4, .2, .5))

# plot predicted value
p + 
  geom_line(aes(x = terminal, y = predicted), 
            data = pred_ss_df,
            color = rgb(.8, .1, .1, 1)) + 
  theme_bw()
```

```{r}
# make prediction using test data
pred_ss_test = predict(fit_ss,
                       x = test_df$terminal)

pred_ss_test_df = data.frame(predicted = pred_ss_test$y,
                             terminal = test_df$terminal)

# plot predicted value
p + 
  geom_line(aes(x = terminal, y = predicted), 
            data = pred_ss_test_df,
            color = rgb(.8, .1, .1, 1)) + 
  theme_bw()
```


Use **a range of degree of freedom** to make predictions:

```{r}
# write a function using a range of df to fit models
ss_func = function(df) {
  
  fit_ss_fun = smooth.spline(x = train_df$terminal, 
                                   y = train_df$outstate,
                                   df = df)
  
  pred_ss_fun = predict(fit_ss_fun, x = test_df$terminal)
  
  
  pred_ss_df_fun = data.frame(predicted = pred_ss_fun$y,
                         terminal = test_df$terminal,
                         df = df)
  
}

# create a list of df
# 1 < df <= 16 - 1
df_list = seq(2, 15, 1)

# run the function using df_list
output_ss = list()

for (x in df_list) {
  output_ss[[x]] = ss_func(x)
}

# do.call() executes a function by its name and a list of corresponding arguments
# e.g. do.call("any_function", arguments_list) 
output_ss_df = do.call("rbind", output_ss) %>% 
  as.data.frame()
```

```{r}
# plot results for a range of df
p + 
  geom_line(aes(x = terminal, y = predicted, group = df, color = df), data = output_ss_df) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = terminal, y = predicted), data = pred_ss_test_df, color = rgb(.8, .1, .1, 1))
```

The above plot shows the fitted smoothing spline models using a range of degree of freedoms. The lines wiggle around the red line, which is the model using the optimum degree of freedom.  
As the degree of freedom approaching to 2, the line gets more linear; as the degree of freedom approaching to 15, the line gets more wiggled.  
Among all the fitted lines within the (2, 15) degree of freedom range, df = `r round(fit_ss$df, 3)` should be the nearest to the red line.



## Generalized Additive Model (GAM)

```{r}
set.seed(2570)

# set cross validation method
ctrl = trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10)

# fit a GAM model using all the predictors
# ngcv package not available for current R version, siwth to caret
gam_fit = train(x = x_train,
                y = y_train,
                method = "gam",
                #tuneGrid = data.frame(method = "GCV.Cp",select = c(TRUE, FALSE)),
                trControl = ctrl)

gam_fit$bestTune

gam_fit$finalModel

summary(gam_fit)
```

```{r}
# plot the results
par(mar=c(1,1,1,1))
par(mfrow = c(4, 4))

plot(gam_fit$finalModel, 
     residuals = TRUE, 
     all.terms = TRUE, 
     shade = TRUE, 
     shade.col = 5)

# train RMSE of final model
gam_train_rmse = sqrt(mean((y_train - predict(gam_fit)) ^ 2))
gam_train_rmse

# make predictions
gam_pred = predict(gam_fit, x_test)

# test RMSE of final model
gam_test_rmse = sqrt(mean(y_test - gam_pred) ^ 2)
gam_test_rmse
```

The training RMSE is`r gam_train_rmse` and the test RMSE is `r gam_test_rmse`.
